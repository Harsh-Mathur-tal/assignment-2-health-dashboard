### 1.2 Real-Time Metrics Dashboard
- **Success/Failure Rate**: Percentage-based metrics with trend analysis
- **Average Build Time**: Time-based metrics with performance insights
- **Last Build Status**: Current state of all monitored pipelines
- **Pipeline Health Score**: Composite metric indicating overall system health

### 1.3 Alerting & Notification System
- **Failure Alerts**: Immediate notifications on pipeline failures

**Key Libraries**:
- React Query/SWR for data fetching
- Socket.io-client for real-time updates
- Recharts or Chart.js for data visualization
- Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling

### 2.3 Database Selection
**Recommended: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension**
- **Rationale**:
  - Excellent for time-series data (pipeline metrics over time)
  - Strong JSON support for flexible pipeline data storage
  - Robust ACID compliance for data integrity
  - Great performance for analytics queries

**Alternative**: MongoDB for more flexible schema requirements

### 2.4 Real-Time Communication
**WebSockets with Socket.io**

- **Required Endpoints**:
  - `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs` - Get workflow runs
  - `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows` - Get workflows
  - Webhook events: `workflow_run`, `workflow_job`

#### Jenkins Integration
- **Jenkins REST API**: Access to build information and logs
- **Jenkins Webhooks**: Build status notifications
- **Required Endpoints**:
  - `/job/{name}/api/json` - Job information
  - `/job/{name}/{number}/api/json` - Build details
  - Build notification plugins for webhooks

### 3.2 Alerting Service APIs

#### Slack Integration
- **Slack Web API**: Send messages to channels
- **Slack Webhooks**: Incoming webhook for notifications
- **Required Scopes**: `chat:write`, `channels:read`

#### Email Integration
- **SMTP Service**: Gmail, SendGrid, or AWS SES
- **Email Templates**: HTML templates for different alert types

### 3.3 External Services
- **Docker Registry**: For container deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for infrastructure monitoring
- **Logging**: ELK stack or similar for centralized logging
