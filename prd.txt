Build a CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard to monitor executions from tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
The dashboard should:
· Collect data on pipeline executions (success/failure, build time, status).
· Show real-time metrics:
o Success/Failure rate
o Average build time
o Last build status
· Send alerts (via Slack or Email) on pipeline failures.
· Provide a simple frontend UI to:
o Visualize pipeline metrics
o Display logs/status of latest builds
This should simulate how modern engineering teams monitor the health of their CI/CD systems using automation, observability, and actionable alerting.

✅ Expected Outcome
The candidate is expected to use GitHub Copilot or Cursor IDE + GPT-4 for ideation, design, and development assistance.

📦 Deliverables
1. 📜 Instructions/Prompts
· Public links or text logs of prompts used with Copilot, Cursor, or ChatGPT.
2. 🧠 Requirement Analysis Document
· Use GPT/CoPilot/Cursor to analyze/expand the requirement.
· Present understanding in terms of:
o Key features
o Tech choices
o APIs/tools required
3. 🏗️ Tech Design Document
· High-level architecture
· API structure (routes, sample response)
· DB schema
· UI layout (explanation)
4. 🔧 Source Code Repository
· Complete source code hosted on GitHub (public or share access)
· Should include:
o Backend (Node.js/Python etc.)
o Frontend (React/Vue or any)
o DB (SQLite/PostgreSQL /)
o Alerting service integration
5. 🚢 Deployment
· Containerize the app (Docker)
6. 📖 Documentation
· README.md containing:
o Setup & run instructions
o Architecture summary
o How AI tools were used (with prompt examples)
o Key learning and assumptions
